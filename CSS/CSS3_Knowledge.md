# CSS3 Knowledge


from CSS:

## Cascade

* http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#cascade
  * Find all declarations
  * Sort according to **importance** (normal or important) and **origin** (author, user, or user agent)
    * user agent, user normal, author normal, author important, user important
  * Sort rules with the same importance and origin by **specificity** of selector
  * If two declarations have the same weight, origin and specificity, the **latter** specified wins

## Selectors

## Specificty

* (ID)(Class/Attr)(type) selectors count

## Inheritance

* mostly font related properties

## The Box Model

* vertical margins collapse

## Positioning

* position: static, relative, absolute, fixed
