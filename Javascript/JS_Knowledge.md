## Functional Programming

* **pure function** is a function that always returns the same result given the same arguments.
* **closure** is a function containing one or more free variables. Free variable are not bound within the function environment. [Read](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read#closures)
* **higher-order function** is a function that either takes functions as arguments or returns a function (or both).
* **combinator** is a higher-order pure function that takes only functions as arguments and returns a function.
* **function decorator** is a higher-order function that takes one function as an argument, returns another function, and the returned function is a variation of the argument function.

Building blocks:
* **composition** - chaining functions
* **partial application** - applying only some of the arguments of a function
